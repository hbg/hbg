**👋 Hey, I'm Harris!**

I'm currently a SWE at DoorDash, but previously attended Caltech 🎓 for undergrad, interned at DoorDash, was a Kleiner Perkins Fellow, and did research at Stanford. Oh, and I love to build - I've been doing that for a few years now! At DoorDash, our experimentation platform powers over **100 Trillion events** per month.
